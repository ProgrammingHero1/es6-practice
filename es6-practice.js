/*
1. let const
2. template string
2.a: use variable
2.b: use object  property
3. arrow function
3.a. with one parameter. will return the number after dividing by 5
3.b. with two parameters. will add two to each number and then multiply the result.
3.c. three parameters. will multiply all three parameters
3.d. with two parameters but it will be a multi line arrow function. will add two to each number and then multiply the result.
make sure you return the result
4. [home work]: javascript function declaration vs arrow function
5. array of numbers. and then map to get each elements multiplied by 5. must use arrow function
6. [challenging] numbers of array. get odd numbers by using filter with arrow function
7. [challenging] array of objects (e.g. products). use find to get the object with price 5000.
8. You have an object. Now use destructing to create a simple variable of any property of the object.
9. [challenging] You have an array. Now use destructing to create a simple (or more) variable to get the third element of the array in a variable called 'three'.
10. [optional] just a write a function with three parameters. and the last parameter will have a default parameter with value 7.
this function will take three parameters and will return the sum of all the three parameters.
